This code is a stopwatch for IOS devices
I used UIButton, UILabel, UISegmentedControl. UIStoryBoard, UIPickwerView.
In first segment there is a stopwatch with three buttons: play, pause and stop. In second segment UIPickerView appears and we can set our countdown for 24 hours maximum
In order to use this code u need Xcode with Swift 5 installed, in addition you might gonna need app Sf Symbols to images appear.
